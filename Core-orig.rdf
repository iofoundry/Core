		<dcterms:abstract>The IOF Core Ontology contains terms and concepts found to be common across multiple domains of industry and represents an OWL implementation of them. The ontology itself utilizes the Basic Formal Ontology or BFO as a philosophical foundation but also imports terms from various domain-independent or &quot;mid-level&quot; ontologies. The purpose of the ontology is to serve or is intended to serve as a core for IOF&apos;s domain-specific ontologies, with a goal being to ensure consistency and interoperability across the suite of ontologies the IOF publishes.</dcterms:abstract>

		<rdfs:comment>An assembly can be a manufactured product or a component of a higher-level assembly, or both.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>This updated definition tries to address many of the issues raised last year (see master working document of IOF terms). Major changes: moved term under material artifact. Dropped class/subclass subassembly and completed assembly. Aligned definition to model it after the one found in businessdictionary.com (see above).

Related terms to be created:

(a) disassembly capability is a a capability, that if realized, is realized in some act of disassembly
(b) act of disassembly is a planned process prescribed by some plan specification (disassembly instructions) wherein an input assembly containing one or more components as parts is taken apart to create outputs: the assembly and one ore more components as separated material artifacts, and which realizes some disassembly capability of the assembly and components.
 Plus, do we need to assert somewhere that disassembly it means to neither damage nor destroy the part being disassembled, nor the components disassembled?</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>powertrain assembly; partially-assembled powertrain + transmission assembly lying nearby; driveshaft assembly temporarily disassembled for repair or routine maintenance; separator assembly consisting of variously-shaped separator parts that safeguard wine bottles in a case of wine during transport; a material artifact produced entirely through additive manufacturing (provided it is a component somewhere, and can it can be disassembled without damage/destruction).</skos:example>
		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. A group of subassemblies and/or parts that are put together and that constitute a major subdivision for the final product. An assembly may be an end item or a component of a higher level assembly [APICS].

2. A combination of parts, components [or] units that form a functional entity [ISO 10795].

3. A set of one or more sub-assemblies or components constituting a single end-use product [ISO/TS 21619].

4. A component or end item comprising of a number of parts or subassemblies put together to perform a specific function, and capable of disassembly without destruction [businessdictionary.com].</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core:xExampleCounter>A car, a machine, a respirator. Although these can be disassembled, they are not components since they are not consumed by or go into any parent assembly or system, and hence are not assemblies.</iof-core:xExampleCounter>

		<iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>something composed of parts that are put together to perform a particular function as prescribed by some design, and in a manner whereby it can be later disassembled</iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>
		<iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>Assembly is a Material Artifact that has &apos;continuant part at some time&apos;, a collection of Components and which bears a disassembly capability.</iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>

		<skos:editorialNote>This term had some extensive discussion back to Top-20 analysis days.  I believe I&apos;ve addressed all the outstanding issues but some of you might want to go back and verify this.

Other non-urgent comments:
1. We may want to add new term Assembly Operation as a subclass of Manufacturing Operation, which is when an Assembly process is prescribed by some manufacturing operation specification. May want to also introduce term assembly line process.

2. We need to do something similar with Assembly Process as we did for Manufacturing Process -- as in separating the generic definition of assembly process from the context-dependent uses of assembly processes in manufacturing. We might then rename this term &quot;Manufacturing Assembly Process&quot;.</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>Mounting wheels on a car main body; welding two metal parts into a single object; automated drilling and riveting of a skin panel operation during fuselage assembly.</skos:example>

		<iof-core:xExampleComplement>Polishing a collection of parts (output is still a collection) &lt;CW&gt; I believe this example can now be dropped since assembly is no longer asserted as a subclass of object aggreegate.</iof-core:xExampleComplement>
		<iof-core:xExampleCounter>3D printing on an existing part (existing part + a pool of printing material -&gt; new part) -- Note that the pool of material is an object before the process but becomes liquid (there is transformation) during the &quot;assembly&quot; process &lt;CW&gt; I believe this can be dropped (see examples/discussion under Assembly).</iof-core:xExampleCounter>

		<rdfs:comment>This definition leaves open the possibility that the business entity that carries the plan that prescribes the process, has no direct participation in the process, which would imply that some 3rd-party agent is playing a causal role as the process unfolds, and is acting on behalf of the Business Entity&apos;s interests.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>1. For many planned processes, the plan that prescribes it is only partially achieved, and that is often as intended (e.g., the business has weekly production plan and today, only a part of it was achieved). Do we need to factor this in? A Barry question.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&roimport;BFO_0000016"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">capability</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. Whereas the BFO term &apos;disposition refers to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, that a material entity may possess, a Capability narrows this down by requiring the existence of an Agent that has an interest in the capability, and requires a capability to be gradable according to some scale or system of reference. 

2. This definition does not attempt to capture &quot;task-based&quot; capabilities that an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone&apos;s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures &quot;proper capabilities.&quot; See related discussion of &quot;proper functions&quot; in the literature. 

3. Not all capabilities are functions. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity through evolution, as &quot;additional benefits,&quot; and are differentiated from function (i.e., purpose). Examples: the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. Yet the function of the car air conditioner certainly forms some material basis of your car&apos;s ability to provide a comfortable experience. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat. The decaying stick on the forest lawn does not have the function to be used as a tool, but certainly a chimpanzee
 may have an interest in using a stick to extract food from a termite mound.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">Capability of a person to play chess at the &quot;master&quot; level; of a team to play football in the professional league; of a lathe to turn at 4,000 RPM; or of your digestive system to digest tiramisu.</skos:example>
		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>From Oxford Languages: Capability is
(1) the power or ability to do something, and
(2) the extent of someone&apos;s or something&apos;s ability.</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core:xExampleComplement>Any capability that is not gradable against a reference system or for which one does not yet exist, is not a capability: the capability of a stick on the forest lawn to be used as a tool by an animal to extract food from a termite mound. The ability of certain bacterium to convert carbon dioxide into fuel in a single enzymatic step, is not a capability until such time that a group of researchers discovers this (and quantifies this ability).</iof-core:xExampleComplement>

There&apos;s a lot of aspects to work through here so let&apos;s revisit the definition for term site and work through the issues with team BFO before introducing a competing term.

Also:
1. I&apos;m assuming based on our realist stance, that we will exclude the location of &quot;virtual things&quot; (e.g., the location of function module in a multi-tiered software system or archietecture), right?

2. What about orientation? Its about time we introduced that notion into the ontology or borrow it from some other source. Can the orientation or &quot;relative physical position or direction of a thing&quot; be captured as a subclass of location, or is it some other immaterial entity? 

3. Let&apos;s not forget term address. It would be nice to get that added to v1 scope. Perhaps borrow this from FIBO and formalize it under BFO;-)

		<skos:editorialNote>1. Notice the changes from Neil&apos;s original definition: &quot;manufacturing enterprise is a business entity whose function is to engage in manufacturing enterprise processes.&quot; 

Main arguments for the changes are: (a) We want more alignment to the SME definition (i.e., it is a business entity established to produce goods for sale -- as in manufactured products). (b) We want to be explicit about &apos;engaging in&apos; some manufacturing process, versus just &apos;participating in&apos; it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only &apos;participate in&apos; the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as &quot;a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.&quot;

2. With this new definition, as with Business Entity, we have a few new terms to introduce: sells, engages in.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&iof-core;BusinessProcess"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">manufacturing enterprise process</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>A manufacturing enterprise process includes as parts many subprocesses that incrementally achieve various objectives carried by a manufacturing enterprise. The agents participating in these planned processes are typically members of the enterprise (permanent and temporary employees), may inlcude contractors and 3rd-parties working or operating under some agreement with the enterprise, or may be automated machines doing the work. Manufacturing enterprise processes include all the activities needed to run the enterprise.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>1. Made a few changes to the definition from what was previously proposed. Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can&apos;t really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is &quot;carried&quot; (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I&apos;m not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

A similar argument we will have when introducing product lifecycle process (or process aggregate).</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:editorialNote>Changes made to the 2019 definition and the reasons why:

1. Renamed this class to &quot;material component&quot; since we may want to introduce a more general parent class (defined class) called component, which allows non-material continuants to be componetized or become parts of other larger non-physical or physical systems. Downstream, we may want to introduce other common subclasses such as Maintainable Component, Packaging Component. and various software components (module, service, function, program, etc.).

2 Removed the comment arguing the case that components, even initially (i.e., raw materials) are self-standing products. Some raw materials or component parts that are consumed by manufacturing are not products (see examples).

3. Moved the term under material entity vs keeping it under material artifact. Some raw materials and parts are not man-made artifacts (e.g., a portion of water that is used to produce bakery goods). Then of course we have the discrete example of the sea shells an employee collects on the beach to be packaged and sold as product.</skos:editorialNote>

		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>From Industrial Contexts:
1. A raw material, part, or subassembly that goes into a higher level assembly, compound, or the final product. This term may also include packaging materials for finished items [APICS].

2. An individual piece used in the assembly of a single unit of equipment [ISO 13533:2001]</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core:xExampleComplement>Assemblies that are components for one manufacturer and final products for another (e.g., the selling of diesel engines is a primary product line of Cummins diesel engine yet a component assembly for its customers, Freightliner Trucks). The context in which a material entity is used needs to be ideally considered in inferring whether it bears the component role.</iof-core:xExampleComplement>
		<iof-core:xExampleCounter>Braking subsystem -- systems and subsystems are object aggregates and often have fiat boundaries, in which case they may be incorrectly inferred as product components. Othertimes, they are systems with bonafide boundaries and should be inferred as a product component.

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">planned process</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. &apos;Planned&apos; is here functioning as a specifier, rather than as a modifier analogous to &apos;cancelled&apos; or &apos;averted&apos;. Therefore, to say that a process is planned is not to say that it has not yet taken place. Rather, it is to say that it is (was or will have been) protocol-driven, instruction-driven, command-driven, or software-driven, or in some combination thereof, as prescribed by one or more directive information content entities. 
				  
2. A planned process remains a planned process even after it has occurred. Hence, the contrast is with accidental processes or with processes that did not turn out as planned (for example because a drill bit broke while realizing a planned drilling process), or with incidental processes not part of the realization of a plan (such as the lathe operator smoking a cigarette while operating her lathe).
				  
3. &apos;Planned&apos; means &apos;protocol driven&apos;. Protocols may be written, spoken, or simply thought – as when upon waking up, we plan, for instance, what to eat for breakfast.</rdfs:comment>

1. At one point we talked about asserting the class under &quot;entity,&quot; thereby allowing services to be treated as products? As of 3-Mar-2020, group decided to leave it as-is.

2. We need to introduce a bunch of the embedded terms: &quot;sells&quot;, &quot;provides&quot;, &quot;market demand,&quot; &quot;granting of rights,&quot;  and &quot;economic exchange.&quot; Let&apos;s see how ontologies for economics and commercie are coming along..

3. Do we want to exclude land and real estate from the definition? E.g., the current definition would include homes manufactured in a factory as well as the buildings and homes commercial and residential builders construct on land, and sell as products, which necessarily will include the land on which they are constructed.</skos:editorialNote>

2. Natural resources: the seashells lying on the beach that some person intends to collect, package and sell; the iron ore in a mountain the rights to which some mining company has just purchased which they intend to mine and sell to iron-making processors. Parcels of real estate some land developer sells to builders.

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">product production process</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. A product production process is distinct from a maintenance process in that, in the latter case, the product exists both before and after the process occurs.

2. A product production process has several planned processes as parts (sub-processes), including at least one manufacturing or assembly process, and  optionally, may include other planned process types such as inspection, packaging, rework, and material-handling.  

3. Note that the various parts of a product production process, for example, inspection, testing, cannot be a product production process by themselves.

4. Some manufacturing processes will also be product production processes.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>The definition above is the latest version from the PPS WG. I think we still need to keep the condition that the product did not exist at the outset or beginning of the process. I left the FOL as previously defined until we decide which way to go. In fact that condition won&apos;t be restrictive enough to exclude mere manufacturing operations and manufacturing processes from being inferred as product production processes. We may need to incorporate more the the differentia from the ISO/APICS definitions to get there.

Other thoughts:
We haven&apos;t included the terms from our service industry use cases -- as in the business model of Service Providers or Manufacturing as a Service. Once we do, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll need to further constrain this term,  Maybe we just go with an elucidation for our first release???</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>Making of an engine block as a product</skos:example>
		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. [A manufacturing process] is the series of operations performed on material to convert it from a raw material or a semifinished state to a state of further completion. Manufacturing processes can be arranged in a process layout, product layout, cellular layout, or fixed-position layout. Manufacturing processes can be planned to support make-to-stock, make-to-order, assemble-to-order, and so forth, based on the strategic use and placement of inventories [APICS &amp; ISO 15531-43].

2. (i) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; is the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product.
 (ii) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; [is a process in which] raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
(iii) &quot;Manufacturing&quot; is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. [Wikipedia]</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>

3. Handling of waste material/Manufactured Product to be incinerated or land-filled. (NOTE: This sort of process is planned, has an output, and the output did not exist at the point of initiation of the planned process.

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">product role</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term &apos;role&apos; is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert &quot;intends to sell&quot; into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product&apos;s life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as &quot;product-in-design role,&quot; &quot;prototype product role,&quot; etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some &quot;end of life&quot; process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled. Example: that pair of shoes AIR MAX 90 ESSENTIAL sneakers sold by Nike bears the role of product throughout its product life cycle, and until Nike stops selling and marketing the style.</rdfs:comment>

		<skos:editorialNote>1. To prevent some of the counter examples, we may want to restrict this to a thing not just available to an agent, but available for use by the agent to carry out or improve the agent&apos;s ability to carry out some function. This would then bring us in closer alignment with the common dictionary definition. Then again, why just focus on functions and not other kinds of realizable entities? 

2. Is a skill or a capability an employee bears, or other specifically-dependent continuants, ever to be considered a resource? 

3. Also, shouldn&apos;t this be a subclass of independent continuant since only those can ever bear roles?

This property is used only during the pre-release/inbetween-releases phase of ontology development and is removed prior to each release.  Allowable designations are as follows:

1) Formalized → term has been analyzed, defined and formalized according to the IOF Technical Principles Guide and the Annotation Property Rules; term has been &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; by WG members with no major issues are outstanding
2) Stable Definition → term has been analyzed and a natural language definition has been identified and adopted by WG members; term however may be lacking in further formalization and may contain terms or notions to be analyzed, defined and added to the ontology
3) In Analysis → term or notion is under analysis by the WG, or has a candidate definition that has not yet been peer-reviewed
4) Pre-analysis → a new term or notion motivated by WG discussions, or one that needs to be introduced because it is contained in the definition of another term that has been adopted; although the analysis for such a term remains to be conducted, it will usually have a candidate natural language definition originating from the context where it is used, or from some external source</skos:editorialNote>
