# Core
A repository for the core ontology files developed for the Industrial Ontology Foundry. 

WARNING: The contents of this repository will undergo a major review by IOF members after a long pause, and may change radically as we drive to publish a first stable release. They are posted as a permanent location for management ontology content in its first and future releases, and as they undergo development. 

This repository contains:
1. An owl implementation of the IOF's top terms ontology, serialized in rdf/xml
2. An import folder of the various imported ontologies which include BFO 2020,  as well as import files containing a subset of terms imported from the Common Core Ontology, and the  Relations Ontology. The import folder also includes the IOF Annotation Vocabulary. 
3. A SPARQL querying for extracting the classes and their annotations.
