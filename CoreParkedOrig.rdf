		<dcterms:abstract>The IOF Core Ontology contains terms and concepts found to be common across multiple domains of industry and represents an OWL implementation of them. The ontology itself utilizes the Basic Formal Ontology or BFO as a philosophical foundation but also imports terms from various domain-independent or &quot;mid-level&quot; ontologies. The purpose of the ontology is to serve or is intended to serve as a core for IOF&apos;s domain-specific ontologies, with a goal being to ensure consistency and interoperability across the suite of ontologies the IOF publishes.</dcterms:abstract>

		<rdfs:comment>1. Ifffffff the agent of an intention is an organization (for example a business entity, a department, a team), then the organizational agent&apos;s intention will be the collective plans (some of which may be shared &amp; others not or at the individual level) of the corresponding person or members of the organization realizing the intention. Where persons of different levels of authority are involved, the subplans will be correspondingly nested. ​FIND LITERATURE ON THIS.
			 
2. Without intentions, planned processes would never materialize (be concretized). 

3. A plan specification may be a formal document, inferred on-the-fly using experience and intuition by a person (the one bearing the intention to be realized) from what is written down (as in an e-mail from his manager), or it may exist as a spoken command that is communicated to the person(s) required to realize it.

		<xIssuesAndActionItems>1. Notice the changes from Neil&apos;s original definition: &quot;manufacturing enterprise is a business entity whose function is to engage in manufacturing enterprise processes.&quot; 

Main arguments for the changes are: (a) We want more alignment to the SME definition (i.e., it is a business entity established to produce goods for sale -- as in manufactured products). (b) We want to be explicit about &apos;engaging in&apos; some manufacturing process, versus just &apos;participating in&apos; it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only &apos;participate in&apos; the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as &quot;a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.&quot;

		<skos:example>1. Drilling operation: A specification to drill a single hole in a workpiece using a machine (drill press). Drilling three holes as part of a single operation.

2. Manual sawing operation: A specification to cut off part of a workpiece. In this case, the worker is using a handheld power saw to accomplish the operation. 

3. Testing. Although testing does not usually consume or modify a workpiece or portion of output material (unless it is an act of destructive testing or some act of drawing a sample to be consumed in a test), it does have as participant the manufactured product, or any input material is intended to or already is a part of the manufactured product.  

4. Setup or teardown of a machine in before/after the actual machining operation.
 
5. Moving a workpiece to the location or site where an operation is to take place. Moving a raw material or component item from stock to staging locations on the shop floor.

6. The disassembly or repair (other types of planned processes) of a manufactured product, or a component intended to be part of one, may or may not be inferred as a manufacturing operation depending on whether an instance of it appears as part of some manufacturing process. On the other hand, an instance of the same assembly, disasembly, or repair operation (e.g., of my Dell laptop at home by an authorized repair agent of Dell&apos;s), would likely be need to be inferred as part of an on-site repair process, or of a planned maintenance work order for some machine that a customer buys and has placed into service in their factory.</skos:example>
		<xDefinitionOtherCommon>A job or task, consisting of one or more work elements, usually done essentially in one location; the performance of any planned work or method associated with an individual, machine, process, department, or inspection; one or more elements that involve one of the following: the intentional changing of an object in any of its physical or chemical characteristics; the assembly or disassembly of parts or objects; the preparation of an object for another operation, transportation, inspection, or storage; planning, calculating, or giving or receiving information. [APICS]</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>1. The label is quite polysemous and means different things in different domains. Renamed the term to manufacturing operation.

2. The above definition has been generalized from what we had in December (&quot;planned process that is part of a product production process and is prescribed by an operation specification) to reflect more closely what this notion means in manufactuirng  (see other common definitions above). Changes include:

(a) Generalized to allow operations to have any number of subclasses in sub-domains (maintenance operation, assembly operation, material handling operation, receiving operation, etc.)

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process. If we need a subclass to capture the type of operations that only &quot;consume&quot; or &quot;modify&quot; input materials to produce semi-finished material entities or manufactured products as output, then we can do so. Or better yet, the PPS working group can do so in their ontology module.

(c) Added restriction that requires participation of some Resource via the &quot;realizes some resource role&quot; clause. 

(d) Added restriction that an operation must occur in a single spatial region.

(e) Planned processes (inspection, test, material change, material modification, material move, etc.) can be realized as part of a manufaturing process, or in other contexts, hence, we make manufacturing operation a defined class, under which any of these can be inferred, when they are part of a manufacturing process.

3. We should probably introduce term location and replace site.

4. Need to introduce new planned processes &quot;material change process&quot; and &quot;material modification process.&quot;</xIssuesAndActionItems>

		<xIssuesAndActionItems>Holding off on the semi-formal/FOL pending further review of the suggested changes in the definition.

Additional comments:
1. The fact that a manufacturing operation is performed in a one location and over a single timeframe, is &quot;cashed out&quot; in our definition, since it surfaces in the definition for manufactuirng operation. 

2. In a change from our 2019 definition, we can&apos;t state that a manufacturing operation is decomposed into a set or sequence of Manufacturing Operation Steps, since this is not universally ltrue: An operation that is entirely automated will not involve human agents, and therefore will have no step-level specifications as parts. What it will have, is a controls-level specification to be programmed into a control system by a controls engineer/programmer.</xIssuesAndActionItems>

		<rdfs:comment>1. A Manufacturing Process Plan is a “blue print” for constructing a new, or reconfiguring an existing factory or production line, or group of production facilities and lines, on which a particular product or mix of products are intended to be produced at some point in the future.

2. Not to be confused with a production plan (a.k.a. production schedule) which is a Plan Specification to produce a particular quantity and mix of products in a factory or production line, that is already constructed and configured to produce such products -- and to do so on short notice as in on a particular day, week or time period in the near future.</rdfs:comment>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>Needs further discussion and peer review: E.g., do we create additional terms to capture lower-level specifications of manufacturing processes (e.g., to capture PPS use cases of drilling/machining (change process), casting (creational process), welding (connective process), etc.)? Barry suggested  we introduce mid-level taxonomic classes Creational Manufacturing Process and Modifying Manufacturing Process. Below these, we would add the various kinds of manufacturing process found in the PPS group. These would then be differentiated from a manufacturing process plan, and the product-production processes they prescribe to produce a specific product.</xIssuesAndActionItems>

ISO 9000:2016] A characteristic is a distinguishing feature.
Note 1 to entry: A characteristic can be inherent or assigned.
Note 2 to entry: A characteristic can be qualitative or quantitative.
Note 3 to entry: There are various classes of characteristic, such as the following: a) physical (e.g. mechanical, electrical, chemical or biological characteristics); b) sensory (e.g. related to smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing); c) behavioural (e.g. courtesy, honesty, veracity); d) temporal (e.g. punctuality, reliability, availability, continuity); e) ergonomic (e.g. physiological characteristic, or related to human safety); f) functional (e.g. maximum speed of an aircraft).</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>The recommendation is to drop this term because (a) &apos;Measured Product Quality&apos; is not a &apos;quality&apos; in the sense of a Foundational ontology. &apos;quality&apos; in sense of a Foundational ontology is an entity we can perceive or measure: shapes, colors, sizes, sounds, smells, as well as weights, lengths, electrical charges. And these aspects are already captured in the definition for term quality. (b) What&apos;s the value in creating a subclass of quality for measurable qualities? Every quality perceived by mankind can be theoretically measured qualitatively or quantitatively, if we put our minds to it. 

Now if the intent was to capture some of the other aspects from ISO&apos;s definition, then perhaps we can open the debate again on the notion of feature vs quality in general, or between distinquishing features and other features, or between qualities that are inherent vs assigned, or those that are qualitative or quantitative, or those that are sensory vs behavioral, vs temporal, vs ergonomic;-)</xIssuesAndActionItems>

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Process Profile</rdfs:label>
		<skos:example>1. On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.</skos:example>

		<xDefinitionOtherCommon>(1) [[ISO 9000:2016] Characteristic [Specification] -- [a specification that describes] a distinguishing feature. 
Note 1 to entry: A characteristic can be inherent or assigned.
Note 2 to entry: A characteristic can be qualitative or quantitative.
Note 3 to entry: There are various classes of characteristic, such as the following: a) physical (e.g. mechanical, electrical, chemical or biological characteristics); b) sensory (e.g. related to smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing); c) behavioural (e.g. courtesy, honesty, veracity); d) temporal (e.g. punctuality, reliability, availability, continuity); e) ergonomic (e.g. physiological characteristic, or related to human safety); f) functional (e.g. maximum speed of an aircraft).

(2)  [[ISO 9000:2016] Quality Characteristic [Specification] -- [a specification that describes] an inherent characteristic of an object related to a requirement.
Note 1 to entry: Inherent means existing in something, especially as a permanent characteristic.
Note 2 to entry: A characteristic assigned to an object (e.g. the price of an object) is not a quality characteristic of that object.</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>1. Moved this under Directive ICE vs being subclass of Specification. Expanded definition to link it to instances of a particular universal type of material entity.
2. Why just limit the scope of this to the obo: Quality of a Material Entity? Look at the wider scope for this under the ISO 9000 definition for characteristic and quality characteristic.
3. Needs to be related to other terms that surface in product/process design and the configuration management space.</xIssuesAndActionItems>

sellers in the marketplace).</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>Open issues: (none are major I believe):
1. Relation provides was introduced and replaces relation sells. Neither relation has been analyzed nor formalized.
2. Problem counter examples of the industrial sort: Resellers are suppliers even while not directly engaging in any manufacturing or act of service provisioning. All person or organization providing goods to the end-consumer are suppliers. 
3. The proposed formalizations for terms Product and Service currently utilize relation sells. We need to rethink introducing relation provides and mixing that with sells for related terms, product and service, and any others we encounter.

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Task</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>A task may be atomic (not broken down further) in one context, yet further decomposed in other contexts. Example: a task may appear to be atomic in a high-level project plan, yet later broken down further in a work breakdown structure or action complex in some detailed project plan.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:example>a machinist loads a workpiece into a milling machine; a supervisor reviews and signs off of an engineering change request</skos:example>
		<xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_project_management]:
(a) Task is part of a set of actions which accomplish a job, problem or assignment.
(b) [A task] in project management [is an] activity that needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time.
 NOTE: A &quot;defined period of time&quot; is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished.
(d) [A task can be part of] a chronological sequence of events, also referred to as a chronology, schedule or timetable.

2. [BPMN/OMG.org]: A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail. It is referred to as an atomic activity. A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram. A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.

3. [APICS]: (a) In project management, the lowest level to which work can be subdivided on a project. (b) In activity-based cost accounting, a task, a subdivision of an activity, is the least amount of work. Tasks are used to describe activities.

4. [International Warehouse &amp; Logistics Association]: The breakdown of the work in an activity into smaller elements, each element being a task.

5. [dictionary]: A piece of work to be done or undertaken.</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xExampleCounter>A robot performing a single task (e.g. of positioning a car door on a car chassis) in a highly automated automotive final assembly line. A further decomposition of the positioning task will likely occur within at the granularity level of the robot programmer. It will be hard to formalize &quot;not broken down further&quot; without some ontological pattern/framework for applying contexts.</xExampleCounter>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>Do we really want to make the committment of not allowing tasks to be &quot;broken down further?&quot; See counter example.

Other thoughts, none urgent:
1. We might introduce subclasses here to differentiate between &quot;human tasks,team-based tasks and competely automated tasks.</xIssuesAndActionItems>

		<xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. [APICS]: Any instrument, such as a saw blade, that is the working part of a machine.

2. [wikipedia] A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment.

2. [dictionary] A tool is a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.

3. [From prior IOF Discussions]: 
(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are &quot;single-item&quot; or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren&apos;t fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term
- Most if not all tools have various interfaces (electronic, mechanical, etc.)</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<xIssuesAndActionItems>1. Made some major revisions to align more with standard definitions. Will formalize if approved.

2. We might want to introduce various subclasses: Mechanical tools, hand tools, powered/machine-based hand tools, cutting tools (linear, rotary, hybrid), instrument, machine tools, etc.</xIssuesAndActionItems>
