		<dcterms:abstract>The IOF Core Parked Ontology extends the IOF Core ontology with additional terms and concepts found to be common across multiple domains of industry and represents an OWL implementation of them. It also maps the Core terms to the Basic Formal Ontology or BFO as a philosophical foundation but also imports terms from various domain-independent or &quot;mid-level&quot; ontologies. The purpose of the ontology is to serve or is intended to serve as a core for IOF&apos;s domain-specific ontologies, with a goal being to ensure consistency and interoperability across the suite of ontologies the IOF publishes.</dcterms:abstract>

		<skos:editorialNote>Not sure we want or need to keep this term. The background on this is that it was introduced during the top-down mapping of IOF terms to BFO, but was never analyzed in IOF discussions. It has its roots in the IAO. My recommendation is to keep the term and we refined above. Also, I assume the IAO meant to say that an action specification &quot;is a directive ICE that describes what an agent in some agentive process should do.&quot;

If the above is acceptable, we need to: (a) Define and reify the relation prescribes Agent Role In; and (b) add term Human Agent as a specialization of Agent, now that we&apos;ve extended that term to include engineered systems.</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:editorialNote>This updated definition tries to address many of the issues raised last year (see master working document of IOF terms). Major changes: moved term under material artifact. Dropped class/subclass subassembly and completed assembly. Aligned definition to model it after the one found in businessdictionary.com (see above).

Related terms to be created:

(a) disassembly capability is a a capability, that if realized, is realized in some act of disassembly
(b) act of disassembly is a planned process prescribed by some plan specification (disassembly instructions) wherein an input assembly containing one or more components as parts is taken apart to create outputs: the assembly and one ore more components as separated material artifacts, and which realizes some disassembly capability of the assembly and components.
 Plus, do we need to assert somewhere that disassembly it means to neither damage nor destroy the part being disassembled, nor the components disassembled?</skos:editorialNote>

3. A set of one or more sub-assemblies or components constituting a single end-use product [ISO/TS 21619].

4. A component or end item comprising of a number of parts or subassemblies put together to perform a specific function, and capable of disassembly without destruction [businessdictionary.com].</iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>

		<skos:editorialNote>This term had some extensive discussion back to Top-20 analysis days.  I believe I&apos;ve addressed all the outstanding issues but some of you might want to go back and verify this.

Other non-urgent comments:
1. We may want to add new term Assembly Operation as a subclass of Manufacturing Operation, which is when an Assembly process is prescribed by some manufacturing operation specification. May want to also introduce term assembly line process.

2. We need to do something similar with Assembly Process as we did for Manufacturing Process -- as in separating the generic definition of assembly process from the context-dependent uses of assembly processes in manufacturing. We might then rename this term &quot;Manufacturing Assembly Process&quot;.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&roimport;BFO_0000016"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">capability</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. Whereas the BFO term &apos;disposition refers to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, that a material entity may possess, a Capability narrows this down by requiring the existence of an Agent that has an interest in the capability, and requires a capability to be gradable according to some scale or system of reference. 

2. This definition does not attempt to capture &quot;task-based&quot; capabilities that an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone&apos;s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures &quot;proper capabilities.&quot; See related discussion of &quot;proper functions&quot; in the literature. 

3. Not all capabilities are functions. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity through evolution, as &quot;additional benefits,&quot; and are differentiated from function (i.e., purpose). Examples: the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. Yet the function of the car air conditioner certainly forms some material basis of your car&apos;s ability to provide a comfortable experience. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat. The decaying stick on the forest lawn does not have the function to be used as a tool, but certainly a chimpanzee
 may have an interest in using a stick to extract food from a termite mound.</rdfs:comment>

		<skos:editorialNote>1. Notice the changes from Neil&apos;s original definition: &quot;manufacturing enterprise is a business entity whose function is to engage in manufacturing enterprise processes.&quot; 

Main arguments for the changes are: (a) We want more alignment to the SME definition (i.e., it is a business entity established to produce goods for sale -- as in manufactured products). (b) We want to be explicit about &apos;engaging in&apos; some manufacturing process, versus just &apos;participating in&apos; it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only &apos;participate in&apos; the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as &quot;a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.&quot;

2. With this new definition, as with Business Entity, we have a few new terms to introduce: sells, engages in.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">manufacturing enterprise process</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>A manufacturing enterprise process includes as parts many subprocesses that incrementally achieve various objectives carried by a manufacturing enterprise. The agents participating in these planned processes are typically members of the enterprise (permanent and temporary employees), may inlcude contractors and 3rd-parties working or operating under some agreement with the enterprise, or may be automated machines doing the work. Manufacturing enterprise processes include all the activities needed to run the enterprise.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>1. Made a few changes to the definition from what was previously proposed. Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can&apos;t really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is &quot;carried&quot; (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I&apos;m not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

A similar argument we will have when introducing product lifecycle process (or process aggregate).</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:editorialNote>1. The label is quite polysemous and means different things in different domains. Renamed the term to manufacturing operation.

2. The above definition has been generalized from what we had in December (&quot;planned process that is part of a product production process and is prescribed by an operation specification) to reflect more closely what this notion means in manufactuirng  (see other common definitions above). Changes include:

(a) Generalized to allow operations to have any number of subclasses in sub-domains (maintenance operation, assembly operation, material handling operation, receiving operation, etc.)

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process. If we need a subclass to capture the type of operations that only &quot;consume&quot; or &quot;modify&quot; input materials to produce semi-finished material entities or manufactured products as output, then we can do so. Or better yet, the PPS working group can do so in their ontology module.

(c) Added restriction that requires participation of some Resource via the &quot;realizes some resource role&quot; clause. 

(d) Added restriction that an operation must occur in a single spatial region.

(e) Planned processes (inspection, test, material change, material modification, material move, etc.) can be realized as part of a manufaturing process, or in other contexts, hence, we make manufacturing operation a defined class, under which any of these can be inferred, when they are part of a manufacturing process.

3. We should probably introduce term location and replace site.

4. Need to introduce new planned processes &quot;material change process&quot; and &quot;material modification process.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>1. Drilling operation: A specification to drill a single hole in a workpiece using a machine (drill press). Drilling three holes as part of a single operation.

2. Manual sawing operation: A specification to cut off part of a workpiece. In this case, the worker is using a handheld power saw to accomplish the operation. 

3. Testing. Although testing does not usually consume or modify a workpiece or portion of output material (unless it is an act of destructive testing or some act of drawing a sample to be consumed in a test), it does have as participant the manufactured product, or any input material is intended to or already is a part of the manufactured product.  

4. Setup or teardown of a machine in before/after the actual machining operation.
 
5. Moving a workpiece to the location or site where an operation is to take place. Moving a raw material or component item from stock to staging locations on the shop floor.

6. The disassembly or repair (other types of planned processes) of a manufactured product, or a component intended to be part of one, may or may not be inferred as a manufacturing operation depending on whether an instance of it appears as part of some manufacturing process. On the other hand, an instance of the same assembly, disasembly, or repair operation (e.g., of my Dell laptop at home by an authorized repair agent of Dell&apos;s), would likely be need to be inferred as part of an on-site repair process, or of a planned maintenance work order for some machine that a customer buys and has placed into service in their factory.</skos:example>

Additional comments:
1. The fact that a manufacturing operation is performed in a one location and over a single timeframe, is &quot;cashed out&quot; in our definition, since it surfaces in the definition for manufactuirng operation. 

2. In a change from our 2019 definition, we can&apos;t state that a manufacturing operation is decomposed into a set or sequence of Manufacturing Operation Steps, since this is not universally ltrue: An operation that is entirely automated will not involve human agents, and therefore will have no step-level specifications as parts. What it will have, is a controls-level specification to be programmed into a control system by a controls engineer/programmer.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:comment>1. A Manufacturing Process Plan is a &quot;blue print&quot; for constructing a new, or reconfiguring an existing factory or production line, or group of production facilities and lines, on which a particular product or mix of products are intended to be produced at some point in the future.

2. Not to be confused with a production plan (a.k.a. production schedule) which is a Plan Specification to produce a particular quantity and mix of products in a factory or production line, that is already constructed and configured to produce such products -- and to do so on short notice as in on a particular day, week or time period in the near future.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>Needs further discussion and peer review: e.g., do we create additional terms to capture lower-level specifications of manufacturing processes (e.g., to capture PPS use cases of drilling/machining (change process), casting (creational process), welding (connective process), etc.)? Barry suggested  we introduce mid-level taxonomic classes Creational Manufacturing Process and Modifying Manufacturing Process. Below these, we would add the various kinds of manufacturing process found in the PPS group. These would then be differentiated from a manufacturing process plan, and the product-production processes they prescribe to produce a specific product.</skos:editorialNote>

Now if the intent was to capture some of the other aspects from ISO&apos;s definition, then perhaps we can open the debate again on the notion of feature vs quality in general, or between distinquishing features and other features, or between qualities that are inherent vs assigned, or those that are qualitative or quantitative, or those that are sensory vs behavioral, vs temporal, vs ergonomic;-)</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:example>1. On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John&apos;s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John&apos;s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call &apos;quality process profiles&apos;, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.</skos:example>

		<skos:editorialNote>Changes made to the 2019 definition and the reasons why:


1 Removed the comment arguing the case that components, even initially (i.e., raw materials) are self-standing products. Some raw materials or component parts that are consumed by manufacturing are not products (see examples).

2. Moved the term under material entity vs keeping it under material artifact. Some raw materials and parts are not man-made artifacts (e.g., a portion of water that is used to produce bakery goods). Then of course we have the discrete example of the sea shells an employee collects on the beach to be packaged and sold as product.

As far as action items:
(a) We may want to rename this class to product component, and introduce a generic parent class called component,, defined along the lines of the standard dictionary definition. 

(b) Once we a generic parent class called component, we may want to introduce other common child classes such as Maintainable Component, Packaging Component. and Software (Information Bearing) Component.</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>portion of water; portion of crude oil; sea shells; bolt; transmission assembly; engine control software</skos:example>
		<iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. A raw material, part, or subassembly that goes into a higher level assembly, compound, or the final product. This term may also include packaging materials for finished items [APICS].

2. An individual piece used in the assembly of a single unit of equipment [ISO 13533:2001]</iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core-pk:xExampleComplement>Assemblies that are components for one manufacturer and final products for another (e.g., the selling of diesel engines is a primary product line of Cummins diesel engine yet a component assembly for its customers, Freightliner Trucks). The context in which a material entity is used needs to be ideally considered in inferring whether it bears the component role.</iof-core-pk:xExampleComplement>
		<iof-core-pk:xExampleCounter>Braking subsystem -- systems and subsystems are object aggregates and often have fiat boundaries, in which case they may be incorrectly inferred as product components. Othertimes, they are systems with bonafide boundaries and should be inferred as a product component. 

Software Components -- sometimes they are components of a product, other times they are fiat subsystems of a software system and not to be inferred as product components.</iof-core-pk:xExampleCounter>

		<skos:editorialNote>The former defintion was &quot;role inhering in a material artifact that is designed to be a proper continuant part of some material artifact.&quot; 

Changes include:
 
(a) replaced material artifact with &quot;material entity since portions of materials and discrete &quot;things&quot; found in nature can be product components. 

(b) replaced material artifact on the output side with manufactured product or product component, 

Future considerations:
(1) In manufacturing contexts, all product components appear in some bill of material, which is a part of a product design. We might add additional conditions to link the material entity that bears to the product BOM that prescribes it.

(d) Added class component role as a parent type to product component role.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:comment>1. A product production process is distinct from a maintenance process in that, in the latter case, the product exists both before and after the process occurs.

2. A product production process has several planned processes as parts (sub-processes), including at least one manufacturing or assembly process, and  optionally, may include other planned process types such as inspection, packaging, rework, and material-handling.  

3. Note that the various parts of a product production process, for example, inspection, testing, cannot be a product production process by themselves.

4. Some manufacturing processes will also be product production processes.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>The definition above is the latest version from the PPS WG. I think we still need to keep the condition that the product did not exist at the outset or beginning of the process. I left the FOL as previously defined until we decide which way to go. In fact that condition won&apos;t be restrictive enough to exclude mere manufacturing operations and manufacturing processes from being inferred as product production processes. We may need to incorporate more the the differentia from the ISO/APICS definitions to get there.

Other thoughts:
We haven&apos;t included the terms from our service industry use cases -- as in the business model of Service Providers or Manufacturing as a Service. Once we do, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll need to further constrain this term,  Maybe we just go with an elucidation for our first release???</skos:editorialNote>

		<iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. [A manufacturing process] is the series of operations performed on material to convert it from a raw material or a semifinished state to a state of further completion. Manufacturing processes can be arranged in a process layout, product layout, cellular layout, or fixed-position layout. Manufacturing processes can be planned to support make-to-stock, make-to-order, assemble-to-order, and so forth, based on the strategic use and placement of inventories [APICS &amp; ISO 15531-43].

2. (i) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; is the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product.
 (ii) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; [is a process in which] raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
(iii) &quot;Manufacturing&quot; is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. [Wikipedia]</iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>

3. Handling of waste material/Manufactured Product to be incinerated or land-filled. (NOTE: This sort of process is planned, has an output, and the output did not exist at the point of initiation of the planned process. Because we do not have in our Manufactured Product role definition that Manufactured Products are intended to be sold, we cannot exclude this counter example.)</iof-core-pk:xExampleCounter>

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">product role</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term &apos;role&apos; is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert &quot;intends to sell&quot; into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product&apos;s life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as &quot;product-in-design role,&quot; &quot;prototype product role,&quot; etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some &quot;end of life&quot; process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled. Example: that pair of shoes AIR MAX 90 ESSENTIAL sneakers sold by Nike bears the role of product throughout its product life cycle, and until Nike stops selling and marketing the style.</rdfs:comment>

To prevent some of the counter examples, we may want to restrict this to a thing not just available to an agent, but available for use by the agent to carry out or improve the agent&apos;s ability to carry out some function.

		<skos:editorialNote>Do we really want to make the committment of not allowing tasks to be &quot;broken down further?&quot; See counter example.

Other thoughts, none urgent:
1. We might introduce subclasses here to differentiate between &quot;human tasks,team-based tasks and competely automated tasks.</skos:editorialNote>

		<iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_project_management]:
(a) Task is part of a set of actions which accomplish a job, problem or assignment.
(b) [A task] in project management [is an] activity that needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time.
 NOTE: A &quot;defined period of time&quot; is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished.
(d) [A task can be part of] a chronological sequence of events, also referred to as a chronology, schedule or timetable.

2. [BPMN/OMG.org]: A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail. It is referred to as an atomic activity. A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram. A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.

3. [APICS]: (a) In project management, the lowest level to which work can be subdivided on a project. (b) In activity-based cost accounting, a task, a subdivision of an activity, is the least amount of work. Tasks are used to describe activities.

4. [International Warehouse &amp; Logistics Association]: The breakdown of the work in an activity into smaller elements, each element being a task.

5. [dictionary]: A piece of work to be done or undertaken.</iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>

		<iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. [APICS]: Any instrument, such as a saw blade, that is the working part of a machine.

2. [wikipedia] A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment.

2. [dictionary] A tool is a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.

3. [From prior IOF Discussions]: 
(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are &quot;single-item&quot; or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren&apos;t fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term
- Most if not all tools have various interfaces (electronic, mechanical, etc.)</iof-core-pk:xDefinitionOtherCommon>

		<rdfs:comment>Transport process includes both the internal (e.g., inside a factory) and external (e.g., between factories) movement of an object</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:editorialNote>1. I think we should change the label to something like &quot;material handling process&quot; or perhaps &quot;material movement process.&quot; The classical meaning of the verb &quot;to transport&quot; means &quot;to take or carry (people or goods) from one place to another by means of a vehicle, aircraft, or ship.&quot; Also, this term is too similar to the classical use of the terms to transport and of various transportation processes as used in the logistics industry. 

2. For the formal definition we have arrived at above, any process where you change the site of a material entity, would be a transport process -- even the picking up of a tool from the site of a tool box as part of the process of setting up a part in a fixture will be inferred as a transport process.</skos:editorialNote>
