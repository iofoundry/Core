		<dcterms:abstract>The IOF Core Ontology contains terms and concepts found to be common across multiple domains of industry. It considers the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a philosophical foundation, but has been designed to be useful without inclusion of BFO, as needed. Extensions that build out some of the concepts represented herein are available in separate ontologies, including the axioms that map this ontology to BFO such that they can be used together and leverage the semantics provided by BFO. The purpose of the ontology is to serve or is intended to serve as a core for IOF&apos;s domain-specific ontologies, with a goal being to ensure consistency and interoperability across the suite of ontologies the IOF publishes.</dcterms:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote xml:lang="en">(1) revised the IRI structure to correspond to the approved approach to IRI representation documented in https://oagiscore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IOF/pages/3564372109/IRI+Structure+and+Format, updated the ontology prefix to be &apos;iof-core&apos; rather than &apos;iof&apos; for better reusability, eliminated unused references in namespace declarations, and ran the RDF serialiser (from FIBO) over the content, (2) revised some x annotations to be editorial notes, per the annotation vocabulary (rather than adding a new annotation for issues and actions), (3) changed labels to lower case, consistent with ISO 704 recommendations, (4) eliminated smart quotes, (5) merged classes that were subclasses of Agent with subclasses of AgentRole, since they were all roles, (6) moved any concepts that are not in the draft refactored core diagram to CoreParked, including all references to BFO and CCO.</skos:changeNote>

		<rdfs:comment>When an organization is an agent, this is because one or more of the persons who are members of the organization (usually referred to an agency), realize its goals, objectives and plans.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:example>an employee; a transportation &amp; logistics provider; a robot; a scheduling system</skos:example>
		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>From the dictionary:
1. A person who acts on behalf of another person or group.

2. A person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect.

3. OBI: A role borne by an entity and that is realized in a process that is part of an investigation in which an objective is achieved. These processes include, among others: planning, overseeing, funding, reviewing.</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core:xExampleComplement>Other types of agents we are not including at this stage: 
1. Of physical and chemical in nature: Cleaning, vulcanizing, fluxing, indicator, sterilizing, emulisifying, refining.

3. In computing: intelligent, artificial, mobile, &amp; autonomous</iof-core:xExampleComplement>
		<iof-core:xIssuesAndActionItems>The IOF has elected to exclude material substances that may, at times, act like or are often referred to as agents, in that they realize some specific function that some person desires (e.g., platinum is a reducing agent in various reduction-type reactions -- as used in a catalytic converter to eliminate or reduce various pollutants in exhausts).

The IOF has at this time excluded other types of non-human agents, such as animals and other organisms (often referred to as biological agents).

4.  The classic definition of agent, which is broader than what the working group has incorporated to date and may be at odds with the latest view of the restructured model is &apos;something or someone that can adapt to and interact with its environment&apos;.  One source for this is an emerging OMG standard on Agents and Events, whose RFP is available at http://www.omg.org/techprocess/meetings/schedule/AMP.html.  Another source is http://www.jamesodell.com/WhatIsAnAgent.pdf.  The latter comes from Jim Odell, who led the Foundation for Physical Intelligent Agents (FIPA) community for many years.  This is similar to what we have in FIBO as well, which is available at https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/AgentsAndPeople/Agents/.</iof-core:xIssuesAndActionItems>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&iof-core;Entity"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">capability</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>1. Whereas the BFO term ‘disposition refers to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, that a material entity may possess, a Capability narrows this down by requiring the existence of an Agent that has an interest in the capability, and requires a capability to be gradable according to some scale or system of reference. 

2. This definition does not attempt to capture “task-based” capabilities that an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone’s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures “proper capabilities.” See related discussion of “proper functions” in the literature. 

3. Not all capabilities are functions. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity through evolution, as “additional benefits,” and are differentiated from function (i.e., purpose). Examples: the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. Yet the function of the car air conditioner certainly forms some material basis of your car&apos;s ability to provide a comfortable experience. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat. The decaying stick on the forest lawn does not have the function to be used as a tool, but certainly a chimpanzee
 may have an interest in using a stick to extract food from a termite mound.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">Capability of a person to play chess at the &quot;master&quot; level; of a team to play football in the professional league; of a lathe to turn at 4,000 RPM; or of your digestive system to digest tiramisu.</skos:example>
		<iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>From Oxford Languages: Capability is
(1) the power or ability to do something, and
(2) the extent of someone&apos;s or something&apos;s ability.</iof-core:xDefinitionOtherCommon>
		<iof-core:xExampleComplement>Any capability that is not gradable against a reference system or for which one does not yet exist, is not a capability: the capability of a stick on the forest lawn to be used as a tool by an animal to extract food from a termite mound. The ability of certain bacterium to convert carbon dioxide into fuel in a single enzymatic step, is not a capability until such time that a group of researchers discovers this (and quantifies this ability).</iof-core:xExampleComplement>

		<rdfs:comment>1. &apos;Planned’ is here functioning as a specifier, rather than as a modifier analogous to ‘cancelled’ or ‘averted’. Therefore, to say that a process is planned is not to say that it has not yet taken place. Rather, it is to say that it is (was or will have been) protocol-driven, instruction-driven, command-driven, or software-driven, or in some combination thereof, as prescribed by one or more directive information content entities. 
				  
2. A planned process remains a planned process even after it has occurred. Hence, the contrast is with accidental processes or with processes that did not turn out as planned (for example because a drill bit broke while realizing a planned drilling process), or with incidental processes not part of the realization of a plan (such as the lathe operator smoking a cigarette while operating her lathe).

Also, I don&apos;t think any of these are urgent, but here are some thoughts:
1. We probably should figure out a way to include some of the complement examples.
